### `/layouts`

Layouts are a great help when you want to change the look and feel of your Nuxt app. For example you want to include a sidebar or have distinct layouts for mobile and desktop.

You can define a default layout by adding a default.vue file inside the layouts directory. This will be used for all pages that don't have a layout specified. The only thing you need to include in the layout is the `<Nuxt />` component which renders the page component.
